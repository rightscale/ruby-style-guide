# The Ruby Style Guide

This Ruby style guide recommends best practices so that real-world Ruby
programmers can write code that can be maintained by other real-world Ruby
programmers. A style guide that reflects real-world usage gets used, and a
style guide that holds to an ideal that has been rejected by the people it is
supposed to help risks not getting used at all &ndash; no matter how good it is.

The guide is separated into several sections of related rules. I've
tried to add the rationale behind the rules (if it's omitted I've
assumed that is pretty obvious).

I didn't come up with all the rules out of nowhere - they are mostly
based on my extensive career as a professional software engineer,
feedback and suggestions from members of the Ruby community and
various highly regarded Ruby programming resources, such as
["Programming Ruby 1.9"](http://pragprog.com/book/ruby3/programming-ruby-1-9)
and ["The Ruby Programming Language"](http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Programming-Language-David-Flanagan/dp/0596516177).

The guide is still a work in progress - some rules are lacking
examples, some rules don't have examples that illustrate them clearly
enough. In due time these issues will be addressed - just keep them in
mind for now.

You can generate a PDF or an HTML copy of this guide using
[Transmuter](https://github.com/TechnoGate/transmuter).

The [rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) project aims to
provide an automated way to check whether a Ruby code base complies
with the style guide. Currently it's far from being production ready and it's missing
lots of features. Everyone is naturally invited to help improve it!

## Coding Style

* Use soft-tabs with a two space indent.
* Keep lines fewer than 100 characters.
* Never leave trailing whitespace.
* Use spaces around operators, after commas, colons and semicolons,
around `{` and before `}`.

    ```Ruby
    sum = 1 + 2
    a, b = 1, 2
    1 > 2 ? true : false; puts 'Hi'
    [1, 2, 3].each { |e| puts e }
    ```

* No spaces after `(`, `[` or before `]`, `)`.

    ```Ruby
    some(arg).other
    [1, 2, 3].length
    ```
* Indent `when` as deep as `case`.

    ```Ruby
    case
    when song.name == 'Misty'
      puts 'Not again!'
    when song.duration > 120
      puts 'Too long!'
    when Time.now.hour > 21
      puts "It's too late"
    else
      song.play
    end

    kind = case year
           when 1850..1889 then 'Blues'
           when 1890..1909 then 'Ragtime'
           when 1910..1929 then 'New Orleans Jazz'
           when 1930..1939 then 'Swing'
           when 1940..1950 then 'Bebop'
           else 'Jazz'
           end
    ```

* Use empty lines between `def`s and to break up a method into logical
  paragraphs.

    ```Ruby
    def some_method
      data = initialize(options)

      data.manipulate!

      data.result
    end

    def some_method
      result
    end
    ```

## Documentation

* Use [YARD](http://yardoc.org)

    ```Ruby
    # Duplicate some text an arbitrary number of times.
    #
    # @param [String] text The String to be duplicated
    # @param [Fixnum] count The Fixnum number of times to duplicate the
    #   text
    # @return [String] The duplicated text
    # @example Duplicate a string
    #   multiplex("mystring", 2) #=> "mystringmystring"
    def multiplex(text, count)
      text * count
    end
    ```

## Syntax

* Use `def` with parentheses when there are arguments. Omit the
  parentheses when the method doesn't accept any arguments.

     ```Ruby
     def some_method
       # body omitted
     end

     def some_method_with_arguments(arg1, arg2)
       # body omitted
     end
     ```

* Never use `for`, unless you know exactly why. Most of the time iterators
  should be used instead. `for` is implemented in terms of `each` (so
  you're adding a level of indirection), but with a twist - `for`
  doesn't introduce a new scope (unlike `each`) and variables defined
  in its block will be visible outside it.

    ```Ruby
    arr = [1, 2, 3]

    # bad
    for elem in arr do
      puts elem
    end

    # good
    arr.each { |elem| puts elem }
    ```

* Never use `then` for multi-line `if/unless`.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    if some_condition then
      # body omitted
    end

    # good
    if some_condition
      # body omitted
    end
    ```

* Avoid the ternary operator (`?:`) except in cases where all expressions 
  are extremely trivial. However, do use the ternary operator(`?:`) over
  if/then/else/end constructs for single line conditionals.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    result = if some_condition then something else something_else end

    # good
    result = some_condition ? something : something_else
    ```

* Use one expression per branch in a ternary operator. This
  also means that ternary operators must not be nested. Prefer
  `if/else` constructs in these cases.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    some_condition ? (nested_condition ? nested_something : nested_something_else) : something_else

    # good
    if some_condition
      nested_condition ? nested_something : nested_something_else
    else
      something_else
    end
    ```

* The `and` and `or` keywords are banned. It's just not worth it. Always 
  use `&&` and `||` instead.
* Avoid multi-line `?:` (the ternary operator); use `if/unless` instead.
* Favor modifier `if/unless` usage when you have a single-line
  body.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    if some_condition
      do_something
    end

    # good
    do_something if some_condition
    ```

* Never use `unless` with `else`. Rewrite these with the positive case first.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    unless success?
      puts 'failure'
    else
      puts 'success'
    end

    # good
    if success?
      puts 'success'
    else
      puts 'failure'
    end
    ```

* Don't use parentheses around the condition of an `if/unless/while`,
  unless the condition contains an assignment (see "Using the return
  value of `=`" below).

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    if (x > 10)
      # body omitted
    end

    # good
    if x > 10
      # body omitted
    end

    # ok
    if (x = self.next_value)
      # body omitted
    end
    ```
* Prefer `{...}` over `do...end` for single-line blocks.  Avoid using
  `{...}` for multi-line blocks (multiline chaining is always
  ugly). Always use `do...end` for "control flow" and "method
  definitions" (e.g. in Rakefiles and certain DSLs).  Avoid `do...end`
  when chaining.

    ```Ruby
    names = ['Bozhidar', 'Steve', 'Sarah']

    # good
    names.each { |name| puts name }

    # bad
    names.each do |name|
      puts name
    end

    # good
    names.select { |name| name.start_with?('S') }.map { |name| name.upcase }

    # bad
    names.select do |name|
      name.start_with?('S')
    end.map { |name| name.upcase }
    ```

    Some will argue that multiline chaining would look OK with the use of {...}, but they should
    ask themselves - is this code really readable and can the blocks' contents be extracted into
    nifty methods?

* Avoid `return` where not required for flow of control.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    def some_method(some_arr)
      return some_arr.size
    end

    # good
    def some_method(some_arr)
      some_arr.size
    end
    ```

* Use spaces around the `=` operator when assigning default values to method parameters:

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    def some_method(arg1=:default, arg2=nil, arg3=[])
      # do something...
    end

    # good
    def some_method(arg1 = :default, arg2 = nil, arg3 = [])
      # do something...
    end
    ```

    While several Ruby books suggest the first style, the second is much more prominent
    in practice (and arguably a bit more readable).

* Using the return value of `=` (an assignment) is ok, but surround the
  assignment with parentheses.

    ```Ruby
    # good - shows intended use of assignment
    if (v = array.grep(/foo/)) ...

    # bad
    if v = array.grep(/foo/) ...

    # also good - shows intended use of assignment and has correct precedence.
    if (v = self.next_value) == 'hello' ...
    ```

* Use `||=` freely to initialize variables.

    ```Ruby
    # set name to Bozhidar, only if it's nil or false
    name ||= 'Bozhidar'
    ```

* Don't use `||=` to initialize boolean variables. (Consider what
would happen if the current value happened to be `false`.)

    ```Ruby
    # bad - would set enabled to true even if it was false
    enabled ||= true

    # good
    enabled = true if enabled.nil?
    ```

* Avoid using Perl-style special variables (like `$0-9`, `$``,
  etc. ). They are quite cryptic and their use in anything but
  one-liner scripts is discouraged.

* Never put a space between a method name and the opening parenthesis.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    f (3 + 2) + 1

    # good
    f(3 + 2) + 1
    ```

* If the first argument to a method begins with an open parenthesis,
  always use parentheses in the method invocation. For example, write
`f((3 + 2) + 1)`.

* Use `_` for unused block parameters.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    result = hash.map { |k, v| v + 1 }

    # good
    result = hash.map { |_, v| v + 1 }
    ```

## Naming

> The only real difficulties in programming are cache invalidation and
> naming things. <br/>
> -- Phil Karlton

* Use `snake_case` for methods and variables.
* Use `CamelCase` for classes and modules.  (Keep acronyms like HTTP,
  RFC, XML uppercase.)
* Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for other constants.
* The names of predicate methods (methods that return a boolean value)
  should end in a question mark.
  (i.e. `Array#empty?`).
* The names of potentially "dangerous" methods (i.e. methods that modify
  `self` or the arguments, `exit!`, etc.) should end with an exclamation
  mark. Bang methods should only exist if a non-bang method exists
  ([More on this](http://dablog.rubypal.com/2007/8/15/bang-methods-or-danger-will-rubyist)).

## Classes

* Avoid the usage of class (`@@`) variables due to their "nasty" behavior
in inheritance.

    ```Ruby
    class Parent
      @@class_var = 'parent'

      def self.print_class_var
        puts @@class_var
      end
    end

    class Child < Parent
      @@class_var = 'child'
    end

    Parent.print_class_var # => will print "child"
    ```

    As you can see all the classes in a class hierarchy actually share one
    class variable. Class instance variables should usually be preferred
    over class variables.

* Use `def self.method` to define singleton methods. This makes the code
  easier to refactor since the class name is not repeated.

    ```Ruby
    class TestClass
      # bad
      def TestClass.some_method
        # body omitted
      end

      # good
      def self.some_other_method
        # body omitted
      end

      # Also possible and convenient when you
      # have to define many singleton methods.
      class << self
        def first_method
          # body omitted
        end

        def second_method_etc
          # body omitted
        end
      end
    end
    ```

* Avoid `class << self` except when necessary, e.g. single accessors and
  aliased attributes.

    ```Ruby
    class TestClass
      # bad
      class << self
        def first_method
          # body omitted
        end

        def second_method_etc
          # body omitted
        end
      end

      # good
      class << self
        attr_accessor :per_page
        alias_method :nwo, :find_by_name_with_owner
      end

      def self.first_method
        # body omitted
      end

      def self.second_method_etc
        # body omitted
      end
    end 
    ```

* Indent the `public`, `protected`, and `private` methods as much as the
  method definitions they apply to. Leave one blank line above them.

    ```Ruby
    class SomeClass
      def public_method
        # ...
      end

      private
      def private_method
        # ...
      end
    end 
    ```

## Exceptions

* Don't use exceptions for flow of control.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    begin
      n / d
    rescue ZeroDivisionError
      puts 'Cannot divide by 0!'
    end

    # good
    if d.zero?
      puts 'Cannot divide by 0!'
    else
      n / d
    end
    ```

* Avoid rescuing the `Exception` class.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    begin
      # an exception occurs here
    rescue
      # exception handling
    end

    # still bad
    begin
      # an exception occurs here
    rescue Exception
      # exception handling
    end
    ```

## Collections

* Prefer `%w` to the literal array syntax when you need an array of
strings.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    STATES = ['draft', 'open', 'closed']

    # good
    STATES = %w(draft open closed)
    ```

* Use `Set` instead of `Array` when dealing with unique elements. `Set`
  implements a collection of unordered values with no duplicates. This
  is a hybrid of `Array`'s intuitive inter-operation facilities and
  `Hash`'s fast lookup.
* Use symbols instead of strings as hash keys.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    hash = { 'one' => 1, 'two' => 2, 'three' => 3 }

    # good
    hash = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 }
    ```

## Strings

* Prefer string interpolation instead of string concatenation:

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    email_with_name = user.name + ' <' + user.email + '>'

    # good
    email_with_name = "#{user.name} <#{user.email}>"
    ```

* Prefer double-quoted strings. Interpolation and escaped characters
  will always work without a delimiter change, and ' is a lot more
  common than " in string literals.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    name = 'Bozhidar'

    # good
    name = "Bozhidar"
    ```

* Avoid using `String#+` when you need to construct large data chunks.
  Instead, use `String#<<`. Concatenation mutates the string instance in-place
  and is always faster than `String#+`, which creates a bunch of new string objects.

    ```Ruby
    # good and also fast
    html = ''
    html << '<h1>Page title</h1>'

    paragraphs.each do |paragraph|
      html << "<p>#{paragraph}</p>"
    end
    ```

## Regular Expressions

* Avoid using $1-9 as it can be hard to track what they contain. Named groups
  can be used instead.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    /(regexp)/ =~ string
    ...
    process $1

    # good
    /(?<meaningful_var>regexp)/ =~ string
    ...
    process meaningful_var
    ```

* Be careful with `^` and `$` as they match start/end of line, not string endings.
  If you want to match the whole string use: `\A` and `\z` (not to be
  confused with `\Z` which is the equivalent of `/\n?\z/`).

    ```Ruby
    string = "some injection\nusername"
    string[/^username$/]   # matches
    string[/\Ausername\z/] # don't match
    ```

* Use `x` modifier for complex regexps. This makes them more readable and you
  can add some useful comments. Just be careful as spaces are ignored.

    ```Ruby
    regexp = %r{
      start         # some text
      \s            # white space char
      (group)       # first group
      (?:alt1|alt2) # some alternation
      end
    }x
    ```

## Percent Literals

* Use `%w` freely.

    ```Ruby
    STATES = %w(draft open closed)
    ```

* Use `%()` for single-line strings which require both interpolation
  and embedded double-quotes. For multi-line strings, prefer heredocs.

    ```Ruby
    # bad (no interpolation needed)
    %(<div class="text">Some text</div>)
    # should be '<div class="text">Some text</div>'

    # bad (no double-quotes)
    %(This is #{quality} style)
    # should be "This is #{quality} style"

    # bad (multiple lines)
    %(<div>\n<span class="big">#{exclamation}</span>\n</div>)
    # should be a heredoc.

    # good (requires interpolation, has quotes, single line)
    %(<tr><td class="name">#{name}</td>)
    ```

* Use `%r` only for regular expressions matching *more than* one '/' character.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    %r(\s+)

    # still bad
    %r(^/(.*)$)
    # should be /^\/(.*)$/

    # good
    %r(^/blog/2011/(.*)$)
    ```
